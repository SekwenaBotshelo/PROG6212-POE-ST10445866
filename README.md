Project Description

This repository contains the deliverables for PROG6212 Portfolio of Evidence (POE) Part 1. The task was to design a non-functional prototype for a Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS).

The CMCS is a proposed system to streamline the process where independent contractor lecturers submit their monthly claims, which are then verified by Program Coordinators and approved by Academic Managers.

This Part 1 submission includes:

Design Documentation: Outlining the key design choices, database structure, GUI layout, assumptions, and constraints.
UML Class Diagram: A visual representation of the database entities and their relationships.
Project Plan: A detailed task breakdown with dependencies and a timeline.
GUI Prototypes: Wireframes for the key screens (Lecturer, Coordinator, Manager, Home, About, Contact, Privacy).

Technical Design

- Architecture: Planned as a multi-tier application (Presentation, Business Logic, Data Access).
- Frontend: Prototype designed for WPF or ASP.NET Core MVC.
- Backend: Will be developed with C# and the .NET framework.
- Database: A normalized relational database schema is proposed using SQL Server.
- UML: A detailed class diagram defines the core entities (User, Lecturer, Claim, ClaimLine, SupportingDocument, Approval) and their relationships.
